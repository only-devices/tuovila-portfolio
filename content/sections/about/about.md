I'm a self-taught, highly-motivated, and detail oriented technical expert with a strong background in SaaS implementation and customer success. I'm passionate about finding creative solutions and better ways to work.

I have a few small side projects, including 3D printing, a homelab powered by various Docker services, and playing the guitar. But **not** acoustic guitar.
